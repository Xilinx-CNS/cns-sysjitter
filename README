sysjitter v1.0

Copyright 2010 David Riddoch <david@riddoch.org.uk>

sysjitter measures the extent to which the system impacts on user-level
code by causing jitter.  It runs a thread on each processor core, and when
the thread is "knocked off" the core it measures how long for.  At the end
of the run it outputs some summary statistics for each core, and optionally
the full raw data.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Supports x86 and x86_64 processors.

- Requires a version of gcc with support for built-in atomics.


Building
--------

  make


Running
-------

    sysjitter <threshold-nsec>

  The argument tells sysjitter to ignore any "interruptions" shorter than
  the value given.  Something in the region of a few hundred nanoseconds is
  a reasonable choice here.

  By default it will run for 70 seconds.  Override as follows:

    sysjitter --runtime 10 500

  Default output is summary statistics for each CPU core.  You can also get
  the raw data out as follows:

    sysjitter --raw sjdata 500

  This will place the raw data in a separate file for each CPU core.  The
  files wil be named "sjdata.<core#>".
